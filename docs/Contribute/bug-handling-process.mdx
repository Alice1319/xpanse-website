# Bug Handling Process

## Overview

xpanse is aiming to build a secure system from the foundation,
applying the best industry practices in terms of development quality. However,
as in every software projects, bugs do happen. This process explains how we
handle bugs.

## How to Report a Bug?

If you think you have found a bug in xpanse, please open an issue in GitHub and in the project that you think is the
source of the issue. Use the provided template:

-   What's the action to reproduce the bug? (Steps to reproduce)
-   What's the result you see? (Actual result)
-   What's the result you expect? (Expected behaviour)
-   Frequency? (always, sometimes, one-time issue)
-   Tested version (Release or commit version, platform)
-   Do you know any workaround of this issue? (link to workaround/mitigation steps etc)
-   Do you have a fix for this issue?

Developers review the reported issues and perform triage (see below). When a fix
is available, the ticket is updated with the details of the solution.

## Bug Triage

The bug triage is a process where developers asses the bug and set its
severity and domain. At the end of this process the bug will:

-   Be classified as a security issue, normal bug, feature request, or be rejected
    if the feature is working as planned or couldn't be reproduced.
-   Have its severity set. Please refer to the documentation of severity levels
    below.

If the bug is classified as a security vulnerability, please also refer to our security guidelines <Link name={'here'} url={'./security'} isOpenInNewTab={false}/>.

If the bug is confirmed as a bug, the developer will assign bug severity:
critical, major, minor or low.

> **_Note:_**
>
> **Critical** severity bugs make a feature unusable, cause a major data loss.
> There is no workaround, or a complex one.
>
> **Normal** severity bugs make a feature hard to use, but there is a workaround
> (including another feature to use instead of the desired one).
>
> **Minor** severity bugs cause a loss of non-critical feature (like missing or
> incorrect logging).
>
> **Low** severity bugs cause minor inconveniences (like a typo in the user
> interface or in the documentation).

The bug can originate in the software developed by the project, or from the dependencies we use from other sources. The
process of handling a bug report will change
between those two cases:

### When the Issue is in the Code Developed by the Project`

In the case where the bug originates in the code directly maintained by the
Project, the bug is handled directly in the bug tracker.

### When the Issue Originates from Dependencies

If the issue was identified in dependencies code, we report an issue in
a way appropriate to that particular dependency project. We store the reference to their
bug report in our bug tracker. Depending on the bug severity,
we might decide to develop and maintain a fix locally. However, we strongly
prefer the dependency library maintainers to fix the issue first, and then get it with a regular dependency version
update.

Please note also that we periodically update maintained dependencies, regardless of the bugs filled in our system. Our
goal is to update to the latest stable version of the project.

## Detailed Workflow

### Bug Sources

Bugs might be reported by different sources, including Project's own findings
(like QA), partner findings or community. There might be
also different ways the Project team learns about the issue, including
chats, discussion forums etc. Issues coming from different sources
are centralized in the bug tracker, which also provides a unified
identification of all issues.

### Acknowledgement and Bug Triage

After the bug is entered, a developer will perform triage. The process starts
from acknowledging the issue and then consists of verifying all the information
provided by the bug reporter to reproduce the issue. The developer performing
triage might ask additional questions. Then they assign severity and domain to
the issue in the bug tracker. They also check which versions are affected and might
modify the severity level set by the reporter.
Any project member, or the bug reporter, who disagrees with the assignment might
comment on the issue.

If there is a fix available from the reporter, the developer also verifies if
the fix is correct and matches the IP policy. If the fix is judged acceptable,
the process might skip to the Releasing step.

We aim at the first answer of the triage (either finishing triage, or additional
questions to the reporter) in three working days for critical bugs and seven days
for other bugs. In case of a critical bug, the person performing triage informs
the maintainers of the affected subsystem.

### Prioritizing and Fixing

Bugs with the severity attached enter the prioritization process. It includes a weekly
meeting when the team reviews bugs entered or modified during the last week: those
during the process of triage, and those with the triage finished. For the bugs with
triage finished, the team sets the priority and might assign it to a developer.

The bug fixes should follow the same contributions guidelines as any other
contribution. The best practice is to develop a fix for the bug in a separate
branch. Fixes for related bugs are possible in the same branch.

### Releasing

When a bug fix is available in a branch, the developer creates a merge request.
When the change is accepted, it's merged in the main branch. The developer in
charge of the bug verifies with the release manager to which branches the change
should be backported.

If the bug comes from a dependent library, developers upstream the bug fix. If
the upstream is delayed, the Project might ship a local fix. However, we aim to upstream all fixes.

During the time of development of the patch and eventual upstream, the developer
updates the documentation (if appropriate), and adds a notification to the release
notes. Our release notes contain: links to bugs fixed in the release, links to CVEs
fixed in the release (publicly known) and a list of CVEs fixed that are still under
embargo.

If the bug is classified as critical, it might be decided to perform a separate
bug-fix release to fix the issue. Otherwise, the bug fix lands in the next bug-fix
release.
