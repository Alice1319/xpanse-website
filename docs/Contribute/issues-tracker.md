# Issues Tracker

In Xpanse project, we track all bugs and new feature requests as GitHub issues.

If you find a bug or want something implemented, then Please report an issue in
our [issues tracker](https://github.com/eclipse-xpanse/xpanse/issues).

When creating a bug make sure you document the steps to reproduce the issue and provide all necessary information like
OS, versions your use, logs. When creating a feature request document your requirements first.

If you want to dive into development yourself then you can also browse for open issues or features that need to be
implemented. Take ownership of an issue and try fix it. Before doing a bigger change describe the concept/design of what
you plan to do. If unsure is the design is good or will be accepted discuss it on GitHub.
