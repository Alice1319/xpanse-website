# Planning

We use options/features within GitHub for development planning and governance activities in xpanse.

### Agile Development Process

We follow Agile/Scrum development process. Each sprint is 2 weeks long.

### Sprint Planning

- Sprint Planning meeting happens every alternate Mondays.
- GitHub [Milestones](https://github.com/eclipse-xpanse/xpanse/milestones) is used for scheduling, planning and reporting sprint deliveries.
- All topics planned in sprints are only tracked as GitHub [issues](https://github.com/eclipse-xpanse/xpanse/issues)

### Roadmap & Backlog

At the moment, all open topics are documented in the GitHub [Project](https://github.com/orgs/eclipse-xpanse/projects/1).
