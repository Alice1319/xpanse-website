# Releases

## Xpanse Website

We re-deploy the Xpanse website for every commit that is done to the `main` branch.

Continuous deployment is implemented based on GitHub actions as configured [here](https://github.com/eclipse-xpanse/xpanse-website/blob/main/.github/workflows/xpanse-website-cd.yml).

## Xpanse

Releasing of Xpanse app to maven central will be implemented in the near future. It is part of our backlog.
