# Security Policy

Security is a very important aspect of Xpanse project as we integrate with multiple APIs and systems.

Learn more about it below.

## Versions

The latest version of Xpanse is supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you found a vulnerability, and even if you are not sure about it, please report it right away by sending an email to: <Link name={'xpanse-dev'} url={'mailto:xpanse-dev@eclipse.org'}/>. Please try to be as explicit as possible, describing all the steps and example code to reproduce the security issue.

We will review it thoroughly and get back to you as fast as possible.

## Public Discussions

Please restrain from publicly discussing a potential security vulnerability.

It's better to discuss privately and try to find a solution first, to limit the potential impact as much as possible.
