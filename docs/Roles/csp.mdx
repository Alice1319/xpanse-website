# Cloud Service Provider

Cloud service providers (CSPs) in the xpanse ecosystem provide all necessary infrastructure and integrations for ISVs
to host their native managed services on their platform.

## Cloud provider integrated mode

In this mode, the role of CSP will be to install xpanse stack on their management layer and make it available for
ISVs to register their services. Once registered, CSPs must validate and approve services that can be allowed to be
hosted in their managed services catalog.

## App store mode

In this mode, the role of CSP is to validate and approve services the ISV can sell on their infrastructure.

> Note: If a CSP wish to simply auto approve service templates, it can be configured in the plugin accordingly by
> implementing this <Link name={'method'} url={'https://github.com/eclipse-xpanse/xpanse/blob/main/modules/orchestrator/src/main/java/org/eclipse/xpanse/modules/orchestrator/OrchestratorPlugin.java#L49'}/>.
