# End User

The end user in the xpanse ecosystem are the customers who consume the native managed services
on the cloud.

## Cloud provider integrated mode

When xpanse is deployed in the **cloud provider integrated** mode,
then the user has no impact. xpanse becomes completely transparent to end user.

### Access

End users use the cloud provider's console and API using his/her IAM credentials of the specific cloud provider
to consume xpanse based services.

## App store mode

When xpanse is deployed in the **app store** mode, then the end user can perform the following actions
via xpanse APIs.

1. Get access to the app store.
2. Add cloud credentials to the key store.
3. Browse through services catalog
4. Choose the service they wish to order.
5. Provide all necessary parameters to deploy service.
6. Deploy service.

After the service is deployed, the end user can use and manage the full lifecycle of the service.

### Access

Accessing the app store depends on the auth provider used by the app store.
End user needs an account based on the app store setup.

Additionally, if end user wishes to have the service hosted on their own cloud tenants,
then the cloud provider specific tenant credentials must be added in the app store.
This also depends on the kind of credentials supported by the respective cloud provider in it's xpanse plugin.
