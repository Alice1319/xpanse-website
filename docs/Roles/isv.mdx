# Independent Service Vendor

Independent Service Vendor (ISV) is the role used by software vendors. ISVs sell their managed software services
using xpanse.

The supported use cases for ISV is the same irrespective of the mode in which xpanse is used.
The only expected difference for ISV between the xpanse modes is how the xpanse APIs are accessed.

## Cloud provider integrated mode

In case of **cloud provider integrated** mode,
ISVs will use the cloud provider specific console and API end points to access the xpanse APIs to register their services.

### Access

ISVs use the cloud provider's console and API using his/her IAM credentials to register their native managed services
using xpanse.

## App store mode

In case of **app store** mode, the xpanse uses the APIs hosted on the app store's management area
to sell services on any cloud provider they wish and is supported by the app store

### Access

Accessing the app store depends on the auth provider used by the app store.
ISV needs an account based on the app store setup and must have the `isv` role associated with it.

Additionally, if ISV wishes sell `service-vendor` hosted service,
then the specific tenant credentials must be configured in the app store.
This depends on the kind of credentials supported by the respective cloud provider in it's xpanse plugin.
