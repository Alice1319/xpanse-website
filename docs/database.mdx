# Database

## Development Environments

For all development purposes, we use a file-based H2 database which is automatically created during the server startup.

### Admin UI

The UI to the H2 DB can be accessed at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console/login.jsp`.
Credentials to this admin UI can be
found <Link name={'here'} url={'https://github.com/eclipse-xpanse/xpanse/blob/main/runtime/src/main/resources/application.properties#L10'}/>.

### Cleanup

Since it's a file-based database, the entries aren't lost with reboot of the server.

To clean up the database, the database files must be simply deleted and the server must be restarted for new fresh DB
files to be recreated. Execute the below command on the root of the folder xpanse project.

```shell
rm *.db
```

> Note:
> The H2 database is purely for development and test purposes only and must be avoided for production installation of
> xpanse.

## Production Environments

We plan to support multiple RDBMS flavors. By **support**, we mean configurations for the database added and also all
functionalities tested.

### MySQL DB

At the moment, this is the only DB that's fully supported.
To use `MySQL` as the database for xpanse, it must be activated by starting the application with profile `mysql` and
by replacing the placeholders for database`username` and `password` as below.

```shell
java -jar xpanse-runtime-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
          -Dspring.profiles.active=mysql \
          -Dspring.datasource.username=${database-username} \
          -Dspring.datasource.password=${database-password}
```

#### Versions Supported

Current supported version of MySQL is `8.1.0`. This is the latest LTS release of MySQL.

#### Default Configuration

The above command will start the xpanse runtime with the following default configurations:

1. MySQL running on the same machine where xpanse is running. (Same localhost)
2. Database is listening on port `3306`.
3. Name of the database is `xpanse`. This must be created on the DB server. It **won't** be automatically created.

The Default configuration file can be
found <Link name={'here'} url={'https://github.com/eclipse-xpanse/xpanse/blob/main/runtime/src/main/resources/application-mysql.properties#L6'}/>.

#### Overriding Default Configuration

We can override the above two default configurations by starting the application as below by replacing the placeholders
with actual values.

```shell
java -jar xpanse-runtime-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
          -Dspring.profiles.active=mysql \
          -Dspring.datasource.username=<replace-with-db-username> \
          -Dspring.datasource.password=<replace-with-db-password> \
          -D spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://<replace-with-db-hostname>:<replace-with-db-port>/<replace-with-db-name>

```

> **Note:** It's safe to provide the database-related properties as environment variables rather than passing them
> directly in the command line.
> In case of this,
> the same property name must be set in UPPERCASE and underscore separated instead of dot for all variables.

> **Note:** Using this startup command, the database can run on any machine that's reachable from the xpanse runtime
> application.

#### MySQL as a Docker Container

MySQL offers official Docker images for running a database as a container.
More details can be found here on the official page of MySQL
website <Link name={'here'} url={'https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/8.0/en/docker-mysql-getting-started.html'}/> and on
DockerHub <Link name={'here'} url={'https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/'}/>.

##### Starting new container

While starting the MySQL docker container for the first time, we can configure `database-host`, `database-port` and
`database-name` as below and the same can be used in starting the xpanse runtime using the command described

<Link name={'above'} url={'./database#overriding-default-configuration'} isOpenInNewTab={false} />.

```shell
docker pull mysql:8.1.0
```

By starting the container with the below command, the database is started by automatically configuring the database with
xpanse database name, database user and password. In addition to that, password for the DB `root` user can also be
updated to the value of our choice.

```shell
docker run --name ${container-name} \
            -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<replace-with-db-root-password> \
            -e MYSQL_DATABASE=<replace-with-db-name> \
            -e MYSQL_USER=<replace-with-db-user> \
            -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=<replace-with-db-password> \
            -p 3306:<replace-with-db-port> -d mysql:8.1.0
```

> **Note:** To avoid passing database related properties in command line, we can use the ` --env-file` option of the `
docker run` command to store all sensitive data.

#### Database Objects Creation

The application automatically creates all database objects such as tables needed by the application when it boots
up and uses a database for the first time.
