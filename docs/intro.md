## Getting Started

xpanse is composed by:

-   an orchestrator responsible for the managed services (deployment, start, stop, ...) and loading
    plugins specific for each supported cloud provider
-   Configuration Language for describing managed services and for deploying these managed services.
-   a REST API to interact with the orchestrator
-   runtime (including cloud provider plugins) assembling all components together in a
    running service
