# Modes

xpanse doesn't have an opinionated implementation. It aims to provide a framework which is flexible
and has all building blocks necessary to use it in different contexts/modes.

Current possible modes of xpanse are **app store mode** and **cloud provider integration mode**.

### Cloud Provider Integrated Mode

In this mode, xpanse is deployed on the management zone of the specific cloud provider that supports xpanse.

With this mode, the services from software vendors are sold as full native managed services on that
cloud provider. The end user won't notice if the service is from an independent software vendor or from
the cloud provider itself.

### App Store Mode

In this mode, xpanse is deployed outside any specific cloud provider's management layer.
Using this mode, the service vendors can use the xpanse platform to sell services on any cloud providers
supported by xpanse.

The end user then uses this one stop-shop to consume services from the cloud provider of his choice.

## High-Level Sequence Diagram

A very high level happy-case service offering and service ordering via xpanse will look like below.
