# Reviews

import Link from '../src/components/link/Link';

When an ISV registers a new template, the service is not immediately available for the end user to consume.
The service template must be reviewed and approved by the CSP for the end user to consume it.

## Approve/Reject Service Template

CSP can then review the service template based on their internal processes and then either approve or reject the service registration request.

### CSP Role

If the Xpanse runtime is Oauth protected and RBAC enabled, then the user must have `csp` role to be able to review the service templates which are submitted.

### CSP Name in Metadata

CSPs must also have metadata in the identity provider configured to allow user to be linked to a specific CSP.
Details for this can found <Link name={'here'} url={'./authentication-authorization#metadata-for-csps'}/>.
