# Service Portability

Service portability is the process of migrating a running service and its data from one cloud service provider to another
service provider.

xpanse implements the service portability using a workflow engine, which supports two different use cases

1. Port service between two different regions with the same cloud service provider.
2. Port service between two different cloud service providers.

    MigrateAPI -->> SERVICE_ORDER: Create MIGRATE order.
    MigrateAPI -->> ACTIVITI: create workflow instance and store ORDER_ID in process variable.
    MigrateAPI -->> SERVICE_ORDER: Update WORKFLOW_ID to MIGRATE order.
    MigrateAPI -->> customer: Return OrderID and OldServiceId
