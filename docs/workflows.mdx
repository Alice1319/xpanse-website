# Workflows

import Link from '../src/components/link/Link';

In xpanse, we consider that workflows will be used more and more since most of the use cases involves multiple steps, and it must be possible to restart the process from in between when something fails.

## Activiti Workflow Engine

xpanse uses <Link name={'Activti'} url={`https://activiti.org/`}/> as our BPMN tool. All workflows can be defined as standard BPMN files.

## Migration Workflow

Activiti workflow engine is used for service migration process where an existing service is migrated to a new CSP. This involves multiple steps such as new service deployment, old service destroy, old data import, etc.

BPMN files can be found <Link name={'here'} url={'https://github.com/eclipse-xpanse/xpanse/tree/main/modules/workflow/src/main/resources/processes'}/>.

## APIs to Control Workflow

xpanse provides APIs which can be used by end users to check workflows that have failed and needs end user to handle the errors. Based on the situation can the users then either close the workflow or retry the workflow.

All APIs related to workflow can be found <Link name={'here'} url={'https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/eclipse-xpanse-bot/XpanseRuntimeApi/v0#/Workflow'}/>.
